# 🎧 Customer Audio Behavior Analysis using Python & SQL

This project analyzes user listening behavior on a streaming platform to identify key trends in audio preferences (e.g., Pop vs. Podcasts), session frequency, and cancellation patterns. The goal is to simulate a real-world analytics project where data insights inform product and retention strategy.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore audio listening behavior per customer
- Calculate the percentage of Pop and Podcast audio listened to
- Analyze cancellation trends across users
- Investigate the impact of discounts on churn
- Visualize relationships between audio engagement metrics

---

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Users who listen to more Podcasts tend to have fewer sessions.
- Cancellation rate is higher for users who received a discount (~86%) vs. those who didn’t (~30%).
- Negative correlation between %Pop and %Podcasts suggests distinct listening clusters.
- Visualization using Seaborn’s `pairplot` and `heatmap` reveals insightful trends.
